### NEW FUN STARTED !

Commit message types

- The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes.
- The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. <br/> Finally, MAJORs add changes that wonâ€™t work with earlier versions.
